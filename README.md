# Gender classifier based on career choice

### Abstract

<p align="justify">
  Career choice is influenced by a vast number of variables such as class, gender, school performance and participation in career development activities. Previous research has shown that career differences by gender might be due to cultural biases and gendered socialization.  In the present paper, the relationship between career expectation and gender is explored across two main questions. The first one is related with the existing differences in gender over areas of study in Spanish universities, and the changes of such gendered differences across a span of 4 years. The second question revolves around finding the strongest variables related to the type of career a student decides to enroll in, to determine if gender seems relevant or not at the moment of prediction when implementing an ML model.
To answer the first question a statistical analysis was made on a dataset describing career choice and gender across the last 4 years in Spain, for the second one, a random forest(RF) algorithm was used with the purpose of examining if there is a relationship between gender and career choice. The results show that Spain follows a trend when it comes to career choice, with women outnumbering men in almost all areas of study but engineering and architecture. Similarly, the results from the implementation of RF show a strong relationship between gender and area of study, following results from previous research. Limitations and further recommendations are described in the discussion section.
